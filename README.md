This Web App is a fun interactive web game, allowing the player to match the FIFA world cup nations Flag with the correct nation. The player is given one random flag at a time and is allowed to choose from two countries, one of which is correct. Once selected, the user is given a success or fail message and the ability to play again.

Additional ideas to extend this application/idea:

* Create a memory matching game, where all of the flags are hidden and you have to find 2 matching flags by flipping over only 2 at a time.
* Timing a user to see how quickly they can successfully identify all flags.
* Use the same codebase to create dynamic self-test by allowing users to supply their own JSON dataset
